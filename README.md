# Logistic Regression from Scratch

## Description
This project implements Logistic Regression from scratch using Python and NumPy, with no external machine learning libraries. The code demonstrates a basic understanding of gradient descent, probability predictions, and binary classification. Logistic Regression is a foundational algorithm in supervised machine learning, particularly used for binary classification problems.

## Features
- Built without any machine learning libraries (like scikit-learn) to illustrate fundamental concepts
- Includes functions for model training, predictions, and weight updates using gradient descent
- Implements sigmoid activation and binary cross-entropy loss calculation
- Customizable learning rate and number of iterations
