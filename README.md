# Logistic Regression from Scratch

## Description
This project implements Logistic Regression from scratch using Python and NumPy, with no external machine learning libraries. The code demonstrates a basic understanding of gradient descent, probability predictions, and binary classification. Logistic Regression is a foundational algorithm in supervised machine learning, particularly used for binary classification problems.

## Features
- Built without any machine learning libraries (like scikit-learn) to illustrate fundamental concepts
- Includes functions for model training, predictions, and weight updates using gradient descent
- Implements sigmoid activation and binary cross-entropy loss calculation
- Customizable learning rate and number of iterations


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas (if using a dataset for testing)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/your-username/logistic-regression-from-scratch.git
2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas

### Usage

1.Import the Logistic Regression class and load your dataset.
2.Fit the model on your data.
3.Use the model to make predictions.
